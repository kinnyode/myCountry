        <h3>
          The Pyramids of Giza, located near Cairo, Egypt, were built during the
          Old Kingdom period of ancient Egyptian history. The construction of
          the pyramids, including the Great Pyramid of Khufu, began around 2580
          BCE and lasted for several decades. These monumental structures served
          as tombs for pharaohs and were built with impressive precision and
          engineering. Today, they stand as a testament to the incredible
          architectural and cultural achievements of ancient Egypt, attracting
          visitors from around the world.
