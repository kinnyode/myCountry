          Chinese, a Sino-Tibetan language, has a long history dating back over
          3,000 years. Its origins can be traced to the Shang Dynasty during the
          2nd millennium BCE. Classical Chinese, known as Literary Chinese, was
          used for formal writing and communication. Modern Standard Chinese,
          based on the Mandarin dialect, became the official language of China
          in the 20th century. With over 1.2 billion native speakers, Chinese is
          one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, representing a
          rich cultural heritage and diverse regional dialects.
